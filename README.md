# Clockwork

A multi-tenant managed inference server, backed by a modified version of TVM.

If this README hasn't been updated, it means the system is still a work-in-progress.

# Pre-requisites

## 1. CUDA

Make sure CUDA is installed and on your PATH.  MPI cluster machines have CUDA 9 installed by default.  You can check if CUDA is installed and the version by running `nvcc --version`

## 2. Installing TVM

Clone our modified TVM and check out our modified branch:
```
git clone --recursive https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/cld/ml/tvm
cd tvm
git checkout clockwork
```

Build TVM
```
cd build
cmake ..
make -j40
cd ..
```

Set `TVM_HOME` environment variable
```
echo "export TVM_HOME=`pwd`" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Add `$TVM_HOME/build` to your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables

## 3. Apt packages

The following apt packages pre-requisites:

Intel Threading Building Blocks
```
apt-get install libtbb-dev
apt-get install libasio-dev
```

# Building Clockwork

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j40
```

# Highly Recommended Environment Modifications

Clockwork is a high-performance system that depends upon predictability.  There are various tweaks to your environment that will make executions more predictable:

## 1. Disable CPU frequency autoscaling

Set the "performance" governor to prevent CPU clock scaling
```
echo performance | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
```

## 2. Increase file and memlock limits

Limits on the number of open files, and the amount of page-locked memory, reduce the total number of DNNs clockwork can keep in memory at any point in time.  A limit of 1024 is too low.  A limit of 16k or higher is acceptable.

Limits can be checked with the `ulimit` command (`ulimit -aH` lists hard limits, `ulimit -a` lists current)

Increase the `RLIMIT_NOFILE` (number of open files) and `RLIMIT_MEMLOCK` (amount of page-locked memory) to unlimited:
1. Open `/etc/security/limits.conf`
2. Add the following lines:
```
*            hard   memlock           unlimited
*            soft   memlock           unlimited
*            hard   nofile            unlimited
*            soft   nofile            unlimited
```
Note: for MPI cluster machines with the default Debian distribution, you will also need to modify `/etc/security/limits.d/mpiprefs.conf`

3. Modify `/etc/systemd/user.conf` and `/etc/systemd/system.conf` to add:
```
DefaultLimitNOFILE=65535
```
4. Restart

## 3. Increase mmap limits

Clockwork uses a lot of shared objects, and we need to increase the mmap limit.  As root, run
```
/usr/sbin/sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=10000000
```

In general you can check mmap limits with:
```
sysctl vm.max_map_count
```

## 3. Disable CUDA JIT

None of the models we feed to Clockwork should have CUDA PTX code (JIT'able code) -- to make sure, set the `CUDA_CACHE_DISABLE=1` environment variable

## 4. Disable GPU frequency autoscaling

Enable persistence mode
```
nvidia-smi -pm 1
```

Disable auto boost
```
nvidia-smi --auto-boost-default=DISABLED
```

List available GPU clock frequencies
```
nvidia-smi -q -d SUPPORTED_CLOCKS
```

Pick a memory and graphics clock frequency (usually the highest), e.g. on volta machines:
```
    Supported Clocks
        Memory                      : 877 MHz
            Graphics                : 1380 MHz
```

Set the default application clock and system clock to those highest values, e.g. on volta machines:
```
nvidia-smi -ac 877,1380
nvidia-smi -lgc 1380
```

FYI:
Graphics cards have CPU core affinity, and this can be checked with `nvidia-smi topo -m`

## 5. Check

Some of these values can be checked by running the Clockwork profiler with:
```
./profile [check]
```

IMPORTANT: when you restart your machine, you will need to set persistence mode again.  Run the checker frequently!

# Troubleshooting

Currently, the CMakeLists assumes CUDA lives in either `/usr/local/cuda/lib64` (the default location in Ubuntu 14.x) or `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/nvidia/current` (the default location for MPI cluster machines).  If you get build errors saying cannot find CUDA or cannot find nvidia-ml, then you'll need to update the `include_directories` and `link_directories` directives in the CMakeLists.txt with the CUDA location on your machine.

Undefined reference to tvm::runtime::ManagedCuda... -- this probably means you didn't build TVM properly.  Make sure you haven't modified or deleted the file `build/config.cmake` in the TVM repository.  `make clean` and `make` TVM again.

Unable to set number of open files with ulimit: default values are picked up from conf files, e.g. /etc/security/limits.conf, but they may be overwritten by files in a subdirectory, e.g. /etc/security/limits.d/*.conf
